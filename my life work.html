<h3><b>Firstly by boiling</b></h3>

<p> There are also many other ways to to purify water locally like;
<ol>
<li>Iodine addition</li>
<li>Clay vessel filtration</li> 
<li>Reverse osmosis</li>
</ol>
<h2>PART TWO:Moddern filter design</h2>
<p> In our society today many of us are ignorant about mordern filter in the world and so this wedpage aims at bringing ideas on water purification and mordern filter design as shown below</p>
<h3><b>The biosand filter design</b></h3>
<p>Schematic diagram of the designed filtration system: Well water was stored in 200 L tank. The first and the third columns are conventional biosand filters (BSF). The column in the middle is the Fe 0 SW unit. The columns are connected each other with a PET tube.</p>

<h3>A domestic filter </h3>
<p>This paper describes the design, construction and testing of a domestic water filter. Its construction was accomplished using mainly locally available materials to make it relatively affordable for both the rural and urban dwellers. The developed raw water filter was tested by using it to filter raw water samples obtained from wells, borehole and r...  </p>
